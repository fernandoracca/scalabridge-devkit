ScalaBridge - Have fun learning Scala
======================================

ScalaBridge is a fun environment where you'll learn Scala irrespective of your background. This project helps you get started quickly.

Familiarize yourself with SBT, the Scala Build Tool. 

```
$ sbt
```

Useful commands in SBT:

  * compile: Compiles your code for syntactic and type correctness
  * run: Executes your programs
  * console: Provides and interactive REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) where you can interactively type commands

From the console, you'll have all imports ready (including many you don't often need)

Doodle and Creative Scala
--------------------------

  * [CreativeScala](https://www.creativescala.org/)
  * [Creative Scala Book](https://www.creativescala.org/creative-scala.html)
  * [Doodle](https://github.com/creativescala/doodle)
  * [Doodle API](https://www.creativescala.org/doodle/api/doodle/core/index.html)
  * [Essential Scala](https://github.com/underscoreio/essential-scala)
  * [Creative Scala Template](https://github.com/underscoreio/creative-scala-template)

To run a demo, consider the following:

```scala
scala> (Image.circle(100).fillColor(Color.red)).draw()
```

You should see a window popup. Try changing the color or the size. Remember to close the window(s) since they can block each other.

You can exit the console using :quit
